<p>
Planning a pregnancy is an exciting step in your life, but it's important to approach it with preparation and awareness. A healthy pregnancy starts long before conception.
</p>

<h4>1️⃣ Preconception Health Check</h4>
<p>
Visit your doctor for a full health screening. Address existing health issues like diabetes, thyroid conditions, or high blood pressure. Start taking prenatal vitamins with folic acid (400-800 mcg daily).
</p>

<h4>2️⃣ Track Your Menstrual Cycle</h4>
<p>
Understanding your ovulation cycle helps you know the best time to conceive. Use an ovulation calculator or AI-based period tracker for more accuracy.
</p>

<h4>3️⃣ Maintain a Balanced Diet</h4>
<p>
Start eating nutrient-rich food: leafy greens, lean proteins, fruits, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods, high caffeine, and alcohol.
</p>

<h4>4️⃣ Lifestyle Adjustments</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Quit smoking, alcohol, or recreational drugs</li>
  <li>Reduce stress with yoga, meditation, or light walks</li>
  <li>Exercise moderately — 30 minutes a day is ideal</li>
</ul>

<h4>5️⃣ Mental & Emotional Readiness</h4>
<p>
Parenting begins long before the baby arrives. Prepare emotionally with your partner. Discuss your plans, responsibilities, and expectations.
</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> A healthy mom = a healthy baby. Start early, stay informed, and take care of yourself. 💖</p>
