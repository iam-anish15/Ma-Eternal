    <h1 class="mb-4">Postpartum Recovery: Healing After Birth</h1>
    <p>
    The first few weeks after childbirth are crucial for your recovery. Your body has gone through major changes — give yourself time, rest, and care.
    </p>
    
    <h4>1️⃣ Physical Recovery</h4>
    <p>
    Whether you had a vaginal delivery or C-section, healing takes time. You may experience soreness, vaginal discharge (lochia), fatigue, or cramps. Use prescribed medications and practice good hygiene.
    </p>
    
    <h4>2️⃣ Nutrition & Hydration</h4>
    <p>
    Continue your prenatal diet rich in iron, protein, calcium, and fiber. Stay hydrated — especially if you’re breastfeeding.
    </p>
    
    <h4>3️⃣ Breastfeeding Support</h4>
    <p>
    Breastfeeding can be challenging initially. Seek help from a lactation consultant if needed. Feed on demand and maintain a comfortable position.
    </p>
    
    <h4>4️⃣ Emotional Well-being</h4>
    <p>
    Mood swings are normal, but if sadness lasts over 2 weeks, it might be postpartum depression. Don’t hesitate to talk to a doctor or therapist.
    </p>
    
    <h4>5️⃣ Gentle Movement</h4>
    <p>
    Start with light stretches or walking. Avoid heavy lifting or intense workouts until cleared by your doctor.
    </p>
    
    <h4>6️⃣ Rest When You Can</h4>
    <p>
    Sleep deprivation is real. Nap when the baby sleeps, ask for help, and avoid overexerting yourself.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Remember:</strong> Healing is not a race. Celebrate small milestones. You are doing an amazing job. 💐</p>
